# HateBiasNet

## Overview
The HateBiasNet is a dataset collected from Twitter, consisting of 3003 tweets. It has been meticulously annotated by three speech-language pathology graduate students, ensuring high-quality labeling of hate speech. This dataset is invaluable for researchers and practitioners working on hate speech detection and natural language processing.

**Source:** Twitter  
**Length:** 3003 tweets  
**Annotators:** Three speech-language pathology graduate students  

The data was annotated by 4 Large Language Models (GPT 3.5, GPT 4o, Gemma, and Llama) for the following 11 biases: Asian, Black, Female, Mental Disability, Muslim, Physical Disability, No Disability, Not Asian, Not Black, Not Female and Not Muslim.
